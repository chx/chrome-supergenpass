# SuperGenPass for Google Chromeâ„¢ by Denis

This Chrome extension allows generating unique passwords for every website
without storing those passwords using the [SuperGenPass engine](http://supergenpass.com/)
in one key press.

If you are ever on a computer without this extension, you can always generate
a password manually by visiting [sgp.sokolov.cc](http://sgp.sokolov.cc/),
or by using any other SuperGenPass tool.

Install the extension [on Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/supergenpass-for-google-c/bmmmhbgdbpnbfefmacdlbpfgegcibkjo).
