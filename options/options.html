			<li>
				<p>Store master password on this options page.
				<p class=clarify>
					Don&rsquo;t worry, the password itself is not stored,
					only a one-way hash is stored.
			<li>
				<p>In a password box, choose your password from the menu by pressing button 1 to 9.
			<li>
				<p>The first time you use a password after opening your browser,
					the extensions will ask you to unlock it.
				<p style="margin-left: -50px">
					<img src="../img/ss/unlock-prompt.png">
				<p class=clarify>
					Careful!
					<br>
					Evil website owners might want to steal your password,
					so always make sure that the popup says
					&lsquo;SuperGenPass for Google Chrome™ by Denis extension
					says&rsquo; and not &lsquo;The page at ... says:&rsquo;!
			<li>
				That&rsquo;s it! The password field is now filled with your generated password.
