If you want to give me some feedback or make a suggestion, create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/denis-sokolov/chrome-supergenpass/issues).

If you want to experiment with the code and maybe even send a pull request, here's how to start working on the extension:

1. Clone the repository anywhere on your disk;
1. Open your Chrome to the extension settings page;
1. Enable the developer mode checkbox;
1. Use `Load unpacked extension` button and choose the newly cloned directory;
1. Temporarily disable the real extension to avoid conflicts.
1. After any edit to the extension files it is a good idea to reload the Chrome extensions page to reload the extension.

Before you start doing really big changes, it is advisable to open an issue to discuss it up front in case to avoid doing work that I will be hesitant to merge in for whatever reason.

Thank you!
